<b>1.1 RMSD ANALYSIS</b>

We observed minimal fluctuations in the RMSD across the different systems, indicating that the MD simulations are very stable, and possibly trapped in the local minima (Figure SX1). The absence of side chains in the FnoCas12aWT I2 experimental structure led to greater structural rearrangements during the initial phase of MD simulation until reaching a minimum energy configuration, albeit less than that observed in other systems.

The RMSD was calculated by comparing each frame of the 1 μs MD trajectory to the corresponding average structure of each system.</div></center>


<b>1.2 RMSF ANALYSIS</b>

RMSF analysis revealed high atomic fluctuations across all four states, limiting its utility in distinguishing functionally relevant differences between conformations (Figure SX2). No consistent pattern emerged that clearly defined transitions along the activation pathway. However, notable exceptions were observed in the REC2 and Nuc domains, which displayed pronounced fluctuations in states S4b and I2 (Figure SX2B and SX2C, respectively). These elevated dynamics may reflect their structural rearrangement roles during the conformational progression of Cas12a. Despite this, the widespread and overlapping flexibility profiles suggest that RMSF alone is insufficient to capture the coordinated domain motions critical for functional activation. Therefore, to better understand the relationship between states, we performed PCA analysis and cross-correlation network analysis.

<b>Root Mean Squared Fluctuation (RMSF) analysis of FnoCas12aKD2P and FnoCas12aWT states.</b> RMSF profile for states A) S2 (FnoCas12aKD2P), B) S4b (FnoCas12aKD2P), C) I2 (FnoCas12aWT), and D) I4 (FnoCas12aWT). RMSF was computed over the production trajectories, with highlighted structural domains REC1 (light green), REC2 (dodger blue), PI (salmon), RuvC (medium purple), BH (hot pink), H1 (purple), WED (tan) and Nuc (grey) and also shown in a representative structure of state I4 (left).
